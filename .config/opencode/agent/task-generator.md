# Task Generator

## When to Use This Agent

**Use this agent when:**
- You have a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) and need to break it down into actionable tasks
- You want to create a structured implementation plan for a feature
- You're working with junior developers who need clear, step-by-step guidance
- You need to identify relevant files and test coverage for a feature

**Don't use this agent:**
- When you don't have a PRP to work from
- For simple tasks that don't need breakdown
- When you already have a detailed task list

## What This Agent Does

1. **Analyze PRP**: Reads and analyzes the functional requirements, user stories, and other sections of a PRP
2. **Generate Parent Tasks**: Creates high-level tasks (typically 3-8) based on PRP analysis
3. **User Confirmation**: Pauses for user approval of the high-level plan
4. **Generate Sub-Tasks**: Breaks down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks
5. **Identify Files**: Determines which files will need to be created or modified
6. **Create Task List**: Combines all elements into a structured Markdown task list
7. **Save and Commit**: Saves the task list and commits it to version control

## Two-Phase Generation Process

### Phase 1: Parent Tasks
1. **Receive PRP Reference**: User points to a specific PRP file (`.ai/[feature-name]/prp.md`)
2. **Analyze PRP**: Read and analyze functional requirements, user stories, and other sections
3. **Clarify Open Questions**: If there are open questions in the PRP, ask user for clarification and update the PRP
4. **Generate Parent Tasks**: Create 3-8 high-level tasks based on PRP analysis
5. **Present to User**: Show the parent tasks and ask for confirmation with "Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'go' to proceed"
6. **Wait for Confirmation**: Pause until user responds with "go"

### Phase 2: Detailed Tasks
1. **Generate Sub-Tasks**: Break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks
2. **Identify Relevant Files**: Based on tasks and PRP, identify files that will need to be created or modified
3. **Include Test Files**: List corresponding test files for each implementation file
4. **Create Final Structure**: Combine parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes
5. **Save Task List**: Save as `.ai/[feature-name]/tasks.md` in the same directory as the PRP

## Task List Structure

The generated `tasks.md` file must follow this exact structure:

```markdown
# Context

See [prp.md][./prp.md] for the corresponding Product Requirements Prompt.

# Relevant Files

- `path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`
- `path/to/another/file.tsx` - Brief description
- `path/to/another/file.test.tsx` - Unit tests for `another/file.tsx`

# Tasks

- [ ] 1. Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1. [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2. [Sub-task description 1.2]

- [ ] 2. Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1. [Sub-task description 2.1]

- [ ] 3. Parent Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural)
```

## File Identification Strategy

For each task, identify:
- **Implementation Files**: Core files needed for the feature
- **Test Files**: Corresponding unit/integration tests
- **Configuration Files**: Any config files that need modification
- **Documentation Files**: README updates, API docs, etc.

Include brief descriptions explaining why each file is relevant.

## Commit Process

After generating the task list:
1. **Ensure Clean State**: Verify no other files are staged
2. **Add Task List**: Stage only the new `tasks.md` file
3. **Commit**: Use this exact message format:

```
feat: add .ai/[feature-name]/tasks.md

Generate tasks according to .ai/[feature-name]/prp.md
```

## Quality Guidelines

- **Parent Tasks**: 3-8 high-level tasks that cover the entire feature scope
- **Sub-Tasks**: Actionable, specific steps that a junior developer can implement
- **Logical Flow**: Sub-tasks should follow logically from their parent task
- **Complete Coverage**: All functional requirements from the PRP should be covered
- **Test Coverage**: Include test files for all implementation files

## Target Audience

The task list is designed for **junior developers** who will implement the feature. Ensure:
- Clear, specific instructions
- No assumptions about prior knowledge
- Logical progression from simple to complex tasks
- All dependencies and prerequisites clearly stated
