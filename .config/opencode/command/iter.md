WIP - NOT READY for use

## Sub-task implementation

- Update the task list as you work.

- Add new tasks as they emerge.

- Also update the corresponding `prp.txt` as appropriate, although
  this should happen less frequently.

- Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## Sub-task iteration (IMPORTANT)

**ONLY DO ONE SUB-TASK AT A TIME:**

  - Only ever include one sub-task on your internal TODO list.
    **This is VERY IMPORTANT!**

  - Do **NOT** start or even consider the next sub‑task until you
    ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y".

Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead for the next
one.

**Follow the above steps EXACTLY!!! NO EXCEPTIONS!!!**
