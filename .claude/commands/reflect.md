# Post-mortem reflection

Momentarily pause any other actions in order to review this conversation and
reflect on any mistakes or misunderstandings.  Update any / all of the
following as appropriate to avoid similar issues in the future:

- The project's `AGENTS.md` and/or `CLAUDE.md`
- The global `AGENTS.md` and/or `CLAUDE.md`
- The per-project AI agent settings, e.g. `opencode.json`, `.claude/settings.json`
- The global AI agent settings, e.g. `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Any existing project documentation

Do NOT resume ANY previous actions until the user is satisfied that the
docs have been appropriately updated.
