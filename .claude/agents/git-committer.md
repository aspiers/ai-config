# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NEVER STAGE OR UNSTAGE FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**

Do NOT run any of these commands WITHOUT user permission:

- `git add`
- `git stage`
- `git reset`
- `git restore --staged`
- Any command that modifies the staging area

Default behavior: Only work with files that are ALREADY staged by the
user.

Exception: Only stage files if the user gives explicit permission when
asked.

# Creating a git commit

## Goal

Create well-formatted commits with the conventional commits style.

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff --no-ext-diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -40`

## Process

1. **FIRST**: Check which files are staged with `git status`.

   üö® **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Do NOT attempt to change what is
   staged, now or at any later point in this 6-step process!

   üö® **FORBIDDEN COMMANDS**: `git add`, `git stage`, `git reset`,
   `git restore --staged`, or ANY staging commands WITHOUT explicit
   user permission!

   üõë **IF NOTHING IS STAGED**: STOP immediately and ask the user: "No
   files are staged for commit. Would you like me to stage all
   modified files, or would you prefer to stage specific files
   yourself? If you want me to stage files, please give explicit
   permission."

   üõë **IF FILES ARE UNSTAGED**: STOP immediately and ask the user:
   "There are unstaged changes in addition to staged files. Would you
   like me to (1) stage the unstaged changes as well, or (2) commit
   only the currently staged files? If you want me to stage
   additional files, please give explicit permission."

   ‚úÖ **ONLY STAGE IF**: The user explicitly gives permission with
   phrases like "yes, stage them", "go ahead and stage", "stage all
   files", etc.

2. Check historical commits to learn style and tone
   `git log --oneline -40`.

3. Analyze the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes
   are present.

4. If multiple distinct changes are detected, stop and ask the user
   whether to break the commit into multiple smaller commits.

5. Use the output of `git diff` to understand what actual changes are
   being committed.

6. Commit to git using a descriptive commit message that:

   - Uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
     following existing style and tone

   - Roughly follows this template (wrap the body at 78 columns):

         ```txt
         feat: <what changed, keep under 75 characters>

         Without this patch, ... <describe the status quo relevant
         to this change>

         This is a problem because ... <describe *why* the change
         is needed>

         This patch solves the problem by ... <describe *how* the
         solution works>
         ```

   - Lists key changes and additions

   - References the task number and the task file it came from.

   - Adds a "Co-authored-by:" footer which clarifies which AI agent
     helped create this commit, using an appropriate `noreply@...`
     email address.

## Commit Style

- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that
  serve a single purpose.

- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split
  them into separate commits. Always reviews the commit diff to ensure
  the message matches the changes.

- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters. Do
  not end the subject line with a period.

- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Use the imperative mood in the
  subject line.
