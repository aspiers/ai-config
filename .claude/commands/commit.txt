# Creating a git commit

Commit to git using a descriptive commit message that:

- Uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)

- Roughly follows this template (wrap the body at 78 columns):

      ```txt
      feat: <what changed, keep under 75 characters>

      Without this patch, ... <describe the status quo relevant
      to this change>

      This is a problem because ... <describe *why* the change
      is needed>

      This patch solves the problem by ... <describe *how* the
      solution works>
      ```

- Lists key changes and additions

- References the task number and the task file it came from.
