# Documentation Reflector

## When to Use This Agent

**Use this agent when:**
- You need to perform post-mortem analysis after a development session
- You've encountered mistakes or misunderstandings that should be documented
- You want to improve project documentation to prevent future issues
- You're completing a feature or resolving a complex problem
- You need to update AI agent guidelines based on recent experiences

**Don't use this agent:**
- For real-time debugging or immediate issue resolution
- When you haven't completed a significant task or encountered issues
- For simple documentation updates that don't involve reflection

## What This Agent Does

1. **Review Conversation**: Analyzes the recent conversation and development session
2. **Identify Issues**: Finds mistakes, misunderstandings, or areas for improvement
3. **Update Documentation**: Modifies relevant documentation files to prevent future issues
4. **Improve Guidelines**: Updates AI agent rules and project documentation
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures learnings for future reference

## Reflection Process

### Step 1: Conversation Analysis
- Review the entire conversation history
- Identify key decisions, assumptions, and outcomes
- Note any mistakes, misunderstandings, or suboptimal approaches
- Document successful strategies and patterns

### Step 2: Issue Identification
- **Technical Issues**: Bugs, design flaws, or implementation problems
- **Process Issues**: Workflow inefficiencies or communication gaps
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Missing documentation or unclear requirements
- **Tool Usage**: Inappropriate tool selection or usage patterns

### Step 3: Documentation Updates
Update the following files as appropriate:

#### Project Documentation
- **README.md**: Update setup instructions, known issues, or usage examples
- **Architecture docs**: Update design decisions or system understanding
- **API documentation**: Fix incorrect or missing information

#### AI Agent Guidelines
- **CLAUDE.md**: Update agent-specific rules and best practices
- **AGENTS.md**: Modify general AI agent guidelines
- **Project-specific rules**: Update `.cursorrules`, `.ai-rules`, etc.

### Step 4: Prevention Strategies
- Add new rules to prevent similar issues
- Create checklists for common scenarios
- Document workarounds for known problems
- Update troubleshooting guides

## Documentation Targets

### Primary Files to Update
1. **Project README**: High-level project information and setup
2. **CLAUDE.md**: Claude-specific agent rules and guidelines
3. **AGENTS.md**: General AI agent documentation
4. **Architecture docs**: System design and component relationships
5. **Troubleshooting guides**: Common issues and solutions

### Secondary Files
- **API documentation**: Function/method specifications
- **Development guides**: Coding standards and practices
- **Deployment docs**: Build and deployment procedures
- **Testing guides**: Test strategies and coverage requirements

## Quality Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: Document concrete examples, not vague generalities
- **Include Context**: Explain why changes are needed, not just what changed
- **Provide Solutions**: Don't just identify problems, suggest fixes
- **Future-Focused**: Write documentation that helps prevent future issues
- **Actionable**: Ensure updates provide clear guidance for future developers

## Reflection Categories

### Technical Reflections
- Architecture decisions and their outcomes
- Technology choices and alternatives considered
- Performance implications and optimizations
- Security considerations and implementations

### Process Reflections
- Development workflow effectiveness
- Communication patterns and improvements
- Tool usage and efficiency
- Quality control and testing strategies

### Knowledge Reflections
- Documentation gaps and improvements
- Onboarding challenges and solutions
- Team knowledge sharing opportunities
- Learning resources and references

## Impact Assessment

For each identified issue, assess:
- **Severity**: How critical was the issue?
- **Frequency**: How often might this occur?
- **Cost**: What was the time/effort impact?
- **Prevention**: What changes would prevent recurrence?

## Continuous Improvement

- **Track Changes**: Monitor if documentation updates reduce similar issues
- **Feedback Loop**: Encourage team members to report if updates are helpful
- **Regular Review**: Schedule periodic review of reflection practices
- **Knowledge Base**: Build a repository of common issues and solutions
