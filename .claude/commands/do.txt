# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on
completing a PRP.

## Task Implementation

- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you
  ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y".

- **Completion protocol:**

  When you finish a sub‑task:

    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code if
      necessary.

    - **Test / lint**: Run all appropriate tests, linters
      etc. according to the provided guidelines for this repository
      (typically in `.ai-rules` or `AGENTS.md` or `AGENT.md` or
      `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` or similar).  If these guidelines are
      missing or unclear then stop and ask for them.

    - If any the above checks fail, try to fix them.  Do **not**
      proceed further until they all pass.

    - Mark the sub-task as completed by changing it `[ ]` to `[x]`.

    - Stage relevant changes via `git add`, taking great care not to
      add unrelated files or changes.  *Do* include the change to the
      `tasks.md` marking the relevant sub-task as completed.

    - Commit to git by following the process in `commit.txt` in the
      same directory as this file.

  3. Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been
     committed, mark the **parent task** as completed.

- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**

   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol
     above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
   - Also update the corresponding `prp.txt` as appropriate, although
     this should happen less frequently.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.
